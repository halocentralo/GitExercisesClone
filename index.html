            <h2>Rider on the storm</h2>
            <p>
                Riders on the storm. 
                Riders on the storm. 
                Into this house we're born 
                Into this world we're thrown 
                Like a dog without a bone 
                An actor out on loan
                Riders on the storm. 
                There's a killer on the road. 
                His brain is squirming like a toad. 
                Take a long holiday 
                Let your children play. 
                If you give this man a ride 
                Sweet memories will die. 
                Killer on the road.
